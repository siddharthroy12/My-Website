There are to methods which most Designers use

1. Copypasting
2. Using Reference

**1. Copypasting:**

By copypasting I don't mean copying the entire design of someone's else website and use it for your website but instead use it as a study material.

When you are new to web design you have to learn a lot of things like Typograhpy, Layout, Colors, etc. And the best way to learn all these thing is to copy the design of your favourite website made by professional designers.

Like for example if you want to learn how to design a product page search "product landing page" or "product page template" on Google Image search and try to replicate it on Figma or any other software of your choice.
